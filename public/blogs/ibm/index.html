<p>Data set reveals that there are 9 qualitative and 26 quantitative parameters about employees working at IBM. However, this is not a true picture as there are many level-based and rating-based variables such as Daily Rate, Environment Satisfaction etc. which have been coded as numerical values.

<p>Over 20% of Sales employees attrite, and Research &amp; Development has minimum attrition. This data makes sense as Research &amp; Development is a proprietary role and IBM must have put in place non-compete policies for such employees. On the other hand, sales is a highly competitive fast-paced role and thus high attrition is to be expected.</p>
